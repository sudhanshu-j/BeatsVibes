## Usage

This project is already designed to be responsive and interactive. Below are some key points on how the website works:

- **Hamburger Menu**: On smaller screens, a hamburger icon will appear in the top right corner. Clicking the icon will toggle the visibility of the navigation menu.

- **Scroll Effects**: As you scroll down, various sections of the page will animate into view, such as images, text, and product cards.

- **Active Links**: The active section in the viewport will highlight the corresponding link in the navigation bar.

- **Scroll-to-Top Button**: The "scroll to top" button will appear once you scroll down 200 pixels or more. Clicking the button will smoothly scroll you back to the top of the page.

## ScrollReveal Implementation

- ScrollReveal.js is utilized to animate elements as they come into view when the user scrolls down the page.

- **Example usage in JavaScript:**

```bash
    ScrollReveal().reveal('.headline', {
       delay: 200,
       distance: '50px',
       origin: 'left',
       opacity: 0,
       duration: 1000
    });
```

Elements with the .headline class will slide in from the left as the user scrolls.
