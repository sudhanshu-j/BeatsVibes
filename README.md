Usage

    • The home page showcases a hero section with an eye-catching banner featuring the latest Beats headphones.

    • As the user scrolls, product features, descriptions, and images will animate into view using ScrollReveal.

    • Call-to-action buttons allow users to navigate to product details or purchase pages.

    • The design is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes for an optimal user experience.

ScrollReveal Implementation

    ScrollReveal.js is utilized to animate elements as they come into view when the user scrolls down the page.

Example usage in JavaScript:

    ScrollReveal().reveal('.headline', {
       delay: 200,
       distance: '50px',
       origin: 'left',
       opacity: 0,
       duration: 1000
    });

    Elements with the .headline class will slide in from the left as the user scrolls.
